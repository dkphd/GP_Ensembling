## Ensembling based on genetic programming

**Work in progress**

This project implements a genetic programming based ensemble creation algorithm.
It uses genetic programming to evolve tree based structures combining predictions of multiple machine learning models. It aims to create an ensemble that achieves as high performance as possible while simultanously keeping it simple.
